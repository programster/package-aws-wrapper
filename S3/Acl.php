 * ACL stands for Access Control List.
 * Amazon S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects.
 * Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines which AWS accounts
 * or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a
 * resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify the requester has the necessary
 * access permissions.
