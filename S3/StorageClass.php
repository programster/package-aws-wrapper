     * In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical,
     * reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard
     * storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in
     * many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage
     * solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is
     * durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other
     * resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.

     * ATM reduced redundancy costs 2.4 cents per GB instead of standard's 3 and has an average
     * loss of 1 in 10,000 objects per year (0.01%).
